// A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

// Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

function hero(bullets, dragons) {
    return bullets >= dragons * 2;

// You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!
// Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).
// Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics
// Simples!
function fixTheMeerkat(arr) {

// It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?
// Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
// If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.
function bonusTime(salary, bonus) {
    // your code here

        let money = salary * 10;
        return `£${money.toString()}`;

// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
// By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.
// E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.
// If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.
// The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!
